In my current job I have had little time to learn anything new or even fine tune my development environment. I think this is a bad practice and it was easy for me to be burnt out. But something happened and I was certain I need to change the way I approach my current job's development environment for _all developers working with me and those who will come after me_.

Suddenly after working on the company's project for about a couple of months, I realised my system was not able to run some of the tools that were needed for the project. But this was something that has been working for so long a time, why is it not working now. Trying to find a solution for my own predicament (because my colleague developers were able to run all their resources on their machines), I realised in the long run that my only bet is to __format__ my machine - which I am not prepared to do anyway. As fate will have it I remembered the days I did a little pro-bono work (teaching) and stumbled of __Linux Containers (LXCs)__.

Why I had a taught about _LXCs_, I can't really tell why. I went back to do a little bit research on LXCs again then I came accross something called __Docker__, something I have heard of but have not bordered to take a look at.
